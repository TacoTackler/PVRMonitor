PVRMonitor
==========
![PVRMonitorScreenshot](http://powervr-graphics.github.io/PVRMonitor/images/PVRMonitor.png)

PVRMonitor allows a user to view real-time hardware performance stats, giving information about processor usage on the CPU and PowerVR graphics hardware (Series5, Series5XT, Series6) with negligible impact on performance. The data is presented as a bar graph, updated in real time and overlaid on top of currently running applications.

PVRMonitor gives immediate feedback on an applicationâ€™s performance, without having to connect to an external profiling tool such as PVRTune.

Stats shown by the application include:

- CPU: Load
- GPU: Total Pixel Load
- GPU: Total Vertex Load
- GPU ALU: Pixel Load
- GPU ALU: Vertex Load

Binaries
==========
The PVRMonitor binary can be downloaded from [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.powervr.PVRMonitor) or through the [PowerVR Graphics SDK installer](http://community.imgtec.com/developers/powervr/installers/).
