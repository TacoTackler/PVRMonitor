{"name":"Pvrmonitor","tagline":"Android app that renders an overlay of CPU and PowerVR GPU performance stats in real-time","body":"![PVRMonitorScreenshot](https://lh3.ggpht.com/JKxSPXWsyOBMvTKjllG-4qk1YKxSRhwEBAUVd-GWH9cT6mOEKJ69oPUeFf9wuO66sA=h900-rw)\r\n\r\nPVRMonitor allows a user to view real-time hardware performance stats, giving information about processor usage on the CPU and PowerVR graphics hardware (Series5, Series5XT, Series6) with negligible impact on performance. The data is presented as a bar graph, updated in real time and overlaid on top of currently running applications.\r\n\r\nPVRMonitor gives immediate feedback on an applicationâ€™s performance, without having to connect to an external profiling tool such as PVRTune.\r\n\r\nStats shown by the application include:\r\n\r\n- CPU: Load\r\n- GPU: Total Pixel Load\r\n- GPU: Total Vertex Load\r\n- GPU ALU: Pixel Load\r\n- GPU ALU: Vertex Load\r\n\r\nBinaries\r\n==========\r\nThe PVRMonitor binary can be downloaded from [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.powervr.PVRMonitor) or through the [PowerVR Graphics SDK installer](http://community.imgtec.com/developers/powervr/installers/).\r\n\r\nSupport\r\n==========\r\nIf you have any questions about PVRMonitor, please contact us through our [public forum](http://forum.imgtec.com/categories/powervr-graphics). We also recommend checking out our [FAQ](http://forum.imgtec.com/categories/powervr-faq) to see if your question has already been answered. If you would prefer to contact us confidentially, you can file a support ticket [here](https://pvrsupport.imgtec.com/new-ticket).\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n==========\r\nPVRMonitor is distributed under the same permissive license as our SDK so it can easily be integrated into commercial and non-commercial applications. You can find the license [here](https://github.com/powervr-graphics/Native_SDK/blob/master/LICENSE.txt). To further clarify the terms, we also have an SDK license FAQ (available [here](http://community.imgtec.com/developers/powervr/faq-about-the-sdk-eula/)).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
